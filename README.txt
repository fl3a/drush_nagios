EXPERPT from a forgotten README.txt:
[...]
You can put your drush command file in a number of places:
  - In a .drush folder in your HOME folder.
  - Along with one of your existing modules. If your command is
    related to an existing module, this is the preferred option.
  - In a folder specified with the include option.
  - In /path/to/drush/commands (not a "Smart Thing to Do", but it would work).
 [...] 


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

Each multi command got a help.
  
To get specific help, type:
